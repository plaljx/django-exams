django-exams is intended to be a reusable, general purpose app for handling all situations where questions have to be presented to website users, and their answers stored and (optionally) analyzed.

Code already exists which achieves much of the project goals, but much polishing is required, and some areas have not been addressed at all yet (statistical analysis of results, for example).

The existing code will be checked in very soon. A demo site will also be available and will be announced here when ready.
